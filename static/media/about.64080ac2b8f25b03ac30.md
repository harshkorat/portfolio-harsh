Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and crafting visually appealing web experiences.

I have a strong foundation in UX design & research, along with expertise in frontend, backend, database, and cloud technologies. I firmly believe in the human element of design and understanding the audience to create simple, functional, and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **Java** and **TypeScript**, focusing on **Cloud** technologies and using **Angular** for frontend development.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, watch football ⚽, cook, play the guitar, explore neighborhoods through food, and occasionally bring out my inner photographer.
